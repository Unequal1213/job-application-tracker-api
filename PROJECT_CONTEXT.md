# PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

## Project

Job Application Tracker API

## Goal

Create a portfolio-ready backend project that demonstrates Python backend development, relational database modeling, CRUD operations, and simple analytics.

The application will help users track job applications, companies, statuses, notes, sources, and basic application statistics.

## Repository

GitHub repository:
https://github.com/Unequal1213/job-application-tracker-api

## Target role

Junior Python Backend Developer

## Planned stack

- Python
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL
- SQLAlchemy
- Alembic
- Pydantic
- Docker
- Pytest
- Ruff
- GitHub Actions

## Architecture direction

Use a clean and understandable structure:

- app/main.py
- app/api/
- app/models/
- app/schemas/
- app/services/
- app/database/

Business logic should live in app/services/ and should not be hardcoded inside API routes.

## Current status

Repository has just been created.

Next step:
Create the initial FastAPI project structure with health endpoint, dependencies, requirements, Ruff, Pytest, Docker-ready structure, and basic CI-ready foundations.

## Important rules

- Do not commit .env.
- Do not hardcode secrets.
- Keep changes small and focused.
- Prefer clear code over clever abstractions.
- Tests should not require a real PostgreSQL database unless explicitly requested.
